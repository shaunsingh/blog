# <span class="project__goal">Goal</span>

After feeling spoiled with more modern cloud hosting solutions and continuous delivery, I wanted to provide a seamless experience to deploy sites on shared hosting environments. Used in conjunction with [clj-sign](//eccentric-j.com/projects/5-clj-sign.html) clj-deploy provides an API to send openssl key pair signed deploy requests to any type of server. This way I can use clj to develop but publish to a PHP server on a host like Bluehost without any hassle of using SFTP to upload files.

An example of a reusable PHP server that works with this library is available at <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> <a href="https://github.com/eccentric-j/php-deployer">eccentric-j/php-deployer</a></span>.

## <span class="project__process">Process</span>

1. Researched signing requests in Clojure
2. Found <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> <a href="https://github.com/jasny/php-pubkey">jasny/php-pubkey</a></span> to guide the server side system
3. Drafted the library in Clojure
4. Created unit tests
5. Refined the library for release

## <span class="project__discoveries">Discoveries</span>

1. Learned how to get the current time since the epoch using `(System/currentTimeMillis)`
2. Learned how to create a pretty solid signed request token
3. Dusted off my PHP skills; just like riding a bike
