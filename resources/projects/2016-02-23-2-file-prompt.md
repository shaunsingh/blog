# <span class="project__goal">Goal</span>

In an early version of our front-end build system we were using browserify which was great but got slower as we added more build files. Before webpack became its successor I built a CLI tool to select files manually and return a stream of them in vinyl format to be compatible with the gulp library. Heavily inspired by `git add --interactive`.

## <span class="project__process">Process</span>
1. Study behavior of `git add -i`
2. Studied redux, introduced by a coworker, to manage application state
3. Replicate the behavior of `git add -i` in JS
4. Take the selected output and return a stream of vinyl files.

## <span class="project__discoveries">Discoveries</span>
- First redux project
- Learned how to write more complex CLI tools
- Introduced to immutability from working with Redux
- More stream experience which made building even more complex tooling even easier
- Learned how to read input with Node&rsquo;s API.
