# <span class="project__goal">Goal</span>

When creating the front-end build tooling for VenueBook we needed a smarter build system that would watch for changes to partial SASS files and only compile the root SASS files that imported them.

## <span class="project__process">Process</span>
1. Study how node-sass&rsquo;s watch command was implemented
2. Find a library that could parse a sass file and return imports.
3. Write software to keep a tree map of the relationships between all SASS files in our project.
4. Leverage gulp watch stream to look up files in the tree to find their root parent files.

## <span class="project__discoveries">Discoveries</span>
- One of my first introductions to streams which is what lead me to functional programming.
- Learned how to graph dependencies for quick lookups.
- Gained experience writing complex front-end build pipelines from scratch.
