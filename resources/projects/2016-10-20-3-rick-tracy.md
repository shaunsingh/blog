# <span class="project__goal">Goal</span>

Prior to webpack, our JS build system started to slow down for all our separate JS apps. Instead of building them all at once with Browserify we wanted a smarter system that could look at a changed source file and find all the root applications that depended on it.

## <span class="project__process">Process</span>

1. Researched existing tools for tracing dependencies
2. Researched combing ES6 Promises and Streams to recursively crawl up a tree of imports without exhausting memory.
3. Architected a class hierarchy to divide responsibilities.
4. Implemented solution in node.
5. Wrote unit tests.

## <span class="project__discoveries">Discoveries</span>

- Learned ES6 Promises
- Made use of the graphing experience with the sass tooling
- Learned the many nuances of transpiling with Babel from ES6 to ES5
- It was fun writing all the code to a detective metaphor way:
    ```js
    // For each lead found start a new investigation
    investigations = leads.map((lead) => {
      return this.trackDown(lead)
        .then((newSuspect) => {
          return this.interrogate(newSuspect, suspect.path);
        })
        .catch(() => {});
    });
    ```
