# <span class="project__goal">Goal</span>

After getting into functional programming I found myself having a hard time working with node&rsquo;s exports. When exporting pure functions it is difficult to mock side-effects compared to OOP classes which allow overriding a method or property. I wanted a way to manage exports more simply and make it easy to stub them out for unit tests.

## <span class="project__process">Process</span>
1. Started by writing out ideal interface code instead of implementation
2. Ran it by coworkers to collect feedback on syntax and if the project is a good idea
3. Implemented the library in node.js using now native ES2015 features
4. Wrote unit tests

## <span class="project__discoveries">Discoveries</span>
- Learned the internals of node&rsquo;s require system
- Gained experience working with pure functions
- Gained better understanding of trade-offs focusing on functional-programming in node.
