# <span class="project__goal">Goal</span>

In developing a larger deploy toolset for sites on shared servers I found myself in need of a library that can use openssl key pairs to sign and verify requests. This would allow a public server to receive requests but only take action on requests sent using a specific key which is not publicly accessible.

## <span class="project__process">Process</span>
1. Researched existing Clojure libraries but found mostly general encryption libs
2. Researched existing java solutions
3. Found a tutorial on [signing and verifying signed requests](https://worace.works/2016/06/05/rsa-cryptography-in-clojure/) (jackpot! :moneybag:)
4. Implemented Clojure solution
5. Wrote unit tests
6. Created PHP test server to receive and verify the signed requests

## <span class="project__discoveries">Discoveries</span>
- Learned how signing and verifying signed requests work
- Learned how to generate key pairs using openssl CLI
- Learned how to convert key pairs to pem format which is what the Java API expects
