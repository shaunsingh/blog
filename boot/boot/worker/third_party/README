URL: http://barbarywatchservice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
Version: r12
Local modifications:
- Delete pre-built binaries in lib/ and bin/
- Delete .idea directory
- Delete WatchService.iml
- Add a LICENSE file for the LGPL, which is the distribution license according
  to the Google Code page
- Remove support for the polling watch service, since the java.nio.file package
  works fine for this, and we don't want to make sure the polling and listening
  watch service behave equivalently with our changes.
- Do not find modified files recursively, and do not include the root directory
  in the list of modified files. This more closely matches how java.nio.file
  works.
